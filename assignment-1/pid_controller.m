% Assignment 1 - Attitude control with PID-controller
%
% Problem III: PID Controller
%
% Goal: On successful completion of the assignment the student shall
%   - be able to use Control system toolbox in MATLAB/Simulink for analysis of simple control systems.
%   - be able to set up simple transfer functions using Laplace-transforms.
%   - be familiar with attitude control with an ideal actuator, ideal sensors and a simple controller.
%   - know some common control system performance metrics (transient analysis).
%   - know the role of the three parts of a PID-controller .
